                                    <p>Don't let the name fool you: a black hole is anything but empty space. Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in outer space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, even light cannot escape their grasp if it comes near enough.</p>
                                    <p>The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. The term "black hole" was coined many years later in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler. After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects, the first physical black hole ever discovered was spotted in 1971. Then, in 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first image ever recorded of a black hole. The EHT saw the black hole in the center of galaxy M87 while the telescope was examining the event horizon, or the area past which nothing can escape from a black hole.</p>
                                    <p>One Star's End is a Black Hole's Beginning: Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the "event horizon," time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a frozen collapsing object.</p>
                                    <p>So far, astronomers have identified three types of black holes: Stellar Black Holes, Supermassive Black Holes and Intermediate Black Holes.</p>
                                    <p><b>Stellar Black Holes:</b> When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun's mass), the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole. Stellar black holes consume the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, which keeps them growing in size.</p>
                                    <p><b>Supermassive Black Holes:</b> Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun, but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way.</p>

                                                <p>Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge together. Large gas clouds could also be responsible, collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass. Supermassive black holes could arise from large clusters of dark matter. This is a substance that we can observe through its gravitational effect on other objects; however, we don't know what dark matter is composed of because it does not emit light and cannot be directly observed.</p>

                                    <p><b>Intermediate Black Holes:</b> Scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes, but recent research has revealed the possibility that midsize or intermediate black holes could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these intermediate black holes forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole.</p>
                                    <p><b><font color="#008000">Facts about Black Holes</font></b></p>
                                    <li>If a star passes too close to a black hole, the star can be torn apart.</li>
                                    <li>We can’t directly see a Black Hole - A black hole is called a black hole because of it’s color, especially since light can’t escape. What we can see, though, is the effects of a black hole. Analyzing the surrounding area of a black hole, we can see its effects upon its environment.</li>
                                    <li>Black holes are safe to observe from a lengthy distance, but not if you get too close, which also means that it’s unlikely for a black hole to consume an entire universe.</li>
                                    <li>Black holes remain terrific fodder for science fiction books and movies. Check out the movie "Interstellar," which relied heavily on Thorne to incorporate science. Thorne's work with the movie's special effects team led to scientists improved understanding of how distant stars might appear when seen near a fast-spinning black hole.</li>
